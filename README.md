Ants
====

Ants is based on the Clojure [ants simulation][ants.clj] by Rich Hickey, and ported to Scala using [Akka][akka] and [Spde][spde].

[ants.clj]:http://clojure.googlegroups.com/web/ants.clj
[akka]:http://akkasource.org
[spde]:http://technically.us/spde/


Requirements
------------

To build and run Ants you need [Simple Build Tool][sbt] (sbt).

[sbt]: http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/


Ants also requires the latest Akka. To build a local version of Akka Core:

    git clone http://github.com/jboner/akka.git
    cd akka
    cd akka-sbt-plugin
    sbt publish-local
    cd ..
    sbt "project akka-core" update publish-local


Running
-------

First time, sbt update to get dependencies:

    sbt update

To run Ants use sbt run:

    sbt run


Self-contained jar
------------------

Rather than building from source there is also a self-contained jar in the Downloads section. Run with:

    java -jar ants-assembly-0.2.jar
